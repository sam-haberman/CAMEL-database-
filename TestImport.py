'''
This is a simple script to demonstrate the editting API 
of CAMEL. If you run it one line at a time, you can see
how different enitities are added, updated and removed.
At the end of the script, the db should be back in its original
state.

Request types:
'GET': retrieve one or more enities as described in the README
'POST': inserts a new experiment or field
'PUT': update an existing experiment or field given the id
'DELETE': remove an existing experiment, field or reference given the id

References can be added and updated as a part of an experiment.
Removing a field will automatically remove all data of that type, just like
removing an experiment will also delete its field data. Orphan references
(references that are not linked to any experiment anymore) are
automatically removed as well.

## URLS
base_url = "https://cameldatabase.com/CAMEL/"
api_url = base_url + "api"
auth_url = base_url + "auth"

exp_url = api_url + "/experiment"
field_url = api_url + "/field"
ref_url = api_url + "/reference"

## Credentials
login = ''
password = ''

if not password:
    import getpass
    password=getpass.getpass()

## Get an authentication token
'''
All editting operations require a header containing a valid AuthToken.
A token stays valid for one day.
'''
auth_request = req.get(auth_url, auth=(login, password))
token = auth_request.headers['AuthToken']

## Create the header we're going to send along
auth_header = {'AuthToken': token}


## Add a new experiment
'''
Adding or updating an element needs a dict that mimics 
the JSON format like a GET request would return.

Field values key/value pairs that do not have a generated ID yet, use a 
random id that's pre-fixed with 'new_'.
